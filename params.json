Users can enter numeric values using a variety of input formats (decimal, hexadecimal, rational), and see how the values would be encoded using the various IEEE-754 binary floating-point formats and rounding modes.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of contributions we would like to see: error analysis, better screen layout, additional and/or additional output options, to name a few. Things the site was never intended to do and thus probably belong somewhere else include calculator operations and support for floating-point formats other than IEEE-754.\r\n","google":""}
